CODE:

Add Block class
+5 buildings
+click listener for shooting http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~zhang/teaching/cpsc3710/samples/pickselect.html
+draw()

Add Street class
+draw()<-Draws one street, not the entire city network, probably better to use mulitple calls in either Boot or a new city class to make the network
+checkIfIntersection() <-Still empty


// Possibility: Add City class which consists of 20 x 20 blocks and a street between each.
// This could simplify our overall program, as long as it doesn't interefere with our ability
// to shoot specific buildings and make them disappear.
